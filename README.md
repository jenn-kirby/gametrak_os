# gametrak_os
This patch extends the gametrak patch from https://x37v.com/x37v/writing/mad-catz-gametrak-mod-for-maxmsp/
The data is different on different operating systems. The patch gametrak.maxpat checks which OS you are using - Windows, Mac OSX and Mac 11+ and routes the data correctly. This allows you to develop a patch using the gametrak on one OS and it will work on another OS. If it does not work on your version of Windows or Mac OS, please let me know and I will update it.
